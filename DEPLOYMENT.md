# Railway Deployment

Tripful runs on [Railway](https://railway.app) as two services from this monorepo.

## Project Topology

| Service | Type | Start Command | Health Check |
|---------|------|---------------|--------------|
| **api** | Nixpacks | `node apps/api/dist/server.js` | `/api/health/ready` |
| **web** | Nixpacks | `node apps/web/.next/standalone/server.js` | `/` |
| **Postgres** | Railway addon | — | Built-in |
| **Storage Bucket** | Railway addon | — | — |

## What's Codified vs Dashboard

### In the repo

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `nixpacks.toml` | Shared build phases: `corepack enable`, `pnpm install`, `pnpm build` |

Railway's config-as-code (`railway.json`) only supports a single file at the repo root, which applies to all services sharing that root. Since our two services need different start commands and health checks, per-service deploy settings live in the Railway dashboard.

### In the Railway dashboard (per service)

Each service must be configured with:

- **Root directory**: `/` (repo root — required for monorepo workspace resolution)
- **Build command override**: see [Build Commands](#build-commands) below
- **Start command**: see table above
- **Health check path and timeout**
- **Environment variables**
- **Public networking** (custom domains)

## Build Commands

Both services share `nixpacks.toml` for the setup phase (`corepack enable`), but need different build commands configured in the Railway dashboard:

| Service | Build Command |
|---------|---------------|
| **api** | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm build:api` |
| **web** | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm build:web` |

The `build:web` script includes copying static assets into the Next.js standalone output, which standalone mode doesn't include by default.

## Environment Variables

### API Service

#### Required

| Variable | Example | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` | Railway reference variable |
| `JWT_SECRET` | (generated) | Min 32 characters |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | `https://tripful.me` | Comma-separated for multiple origins |

#### Twilio Verify (production SMS auth)

| Variable | Example | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | `ACxxxxxxxxxx` | |
| `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` | (secret) | |
| `TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID` | `VAxxxxxxxxxx` | |
| `ENABLE_FIXED_VERIFICATION_CODE` | `false` | **Must be false in production** (server crashes if true) |

#### S3 Storage (Railway Storage Bucket)

| Variable | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| `STORAGE_PROVIDER` | `s3` |
| `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` | Auto-set by Railway Storage Bucket preset |
| `AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME` | Auto-set by Railway Storage Bucket preset |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Auto-set by Railway Storage Bucket preset |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Auto-set by Railway Storage Bucket preset |
| `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` | Auto-set by Railway Storage Bucket preset |

#### Security / Networking

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `TRUST_PROXY` | `false` | Set `true` behind Railway's proxy |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | `true` (prod) | |
| `COOKIE_DOMAIN` | — | e.g. `.tripful.me` for cross-subdomain auth |
| `EXPOSE_ERROR_DETAILS` | `false` (prod) | |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | |

### Web Service

| Variable | Example | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | `https://api.tripful.me/api` | Browser-side API URL |
| `API_URL` | `http://api.railway.internal:8000/api` | Server-side (RSC) — use Railway private networking |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | `https://tripful.me` | For SEO (robots.txt, sitemap) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_POLLING` | `false` | Disable TanStack Query polling to prevent rate limiting |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Railway sets this automatically |

## Health Checks

The API exposes three health endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose | Failure |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `GET /api/health/` | Full status | 503 if DB down |
| `GET /api/health/live` | Liveness probe | Always 200 |
| `GET /api/health/ready` | Readiness probe | 503 if DB down |

Use `/api/health/ready` as the Railway health check — it returns 503 when the database is unreachable, preventing traffic to unhealthy instances.

## Database Migrations

Migrations run via `drizzle-kit migrate`. Options:

1. **Pre-deploy command** (recommended): Set in Railway dashboard for the API service: `cd apps/api && pnpm db:migrate`
2. **Manual**: `railway run -s api -- sh -c "cd apps/api && pnpm db:migrate"`

## Production Safety Guards

- `ENABLE_FIXED_VERIFICATION_CODE=true` + `NODE_ENV=production` → server exits with code 1
- Twilio env vars are validated when mock verification is disabled
- `COOKIE_SECURE` defaults to `true` in production
- Helmet security headers (CSP, HSTS, CORP) are enabled
