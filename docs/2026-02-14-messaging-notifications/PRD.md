# Tripful - Messaging & Notifications

## Overview

A messaging and notification system for Tripful that enables trip members to communicate within trips and stay informed about important updates. The messaging service provides a Partiful-style discussion feed on each trip page where going members can post, reply, and react. The notification service delivers in-app and SMS alerts for event reminders, daily itineraries, and trip messages.

## Goals

1. Enable going members to discuss trip plans in context, directly on the trip page
2. Keep members informed about upcoming events and daily schedules without leaving the app
3. Give organizers moderation tools to manage conversations (delete, pin, mute)
4. Support SMS delivery for members who want alerts outside the app
5. Let members control their notification preferences per trip

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Trip members who want to coordinate logistics, share excitement, and stay in the loop
- **Secondary**: Trip organizers who need to broadcast important updates and moderate discussion

## Terminology

| **Reply**                   | A response to a top-level message (flat threading, not nested)                                      |

| **Notification**            | An in-app alert about trip activity (event reminder, daily itinerary, new message)                  |
| **Notification Preferences** | Per-trip toggles controlling which notification types a member receives (in-app + SMS)              |
| **Pinned Message**          | A message promoted to the top of the feed by an organizer                                           |
| **Muted Member**            | A member blocked from posting messages by an organizer                                              |
