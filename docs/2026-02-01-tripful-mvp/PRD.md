# Tripful - Collaborative Trip Itinerary Platform

## Overview

A collaborative trip planning platform that makes group travel itineraries simple. Organizers create trips, invite members via phone, and accepted members collaboratively build the itinerary together. Perfect for bachelor parties, ski trips, weddings, and any group travel.

## Goals

1. Make group trip planning as simple as possible - collaborative by default
2. Enable accepted members to contribute to the itinerary (travel, meals, activities)
3. Provide a shared source of truth for group trip plans
4. Leverage phone numbers for seamless invitations (SMS-native like Partiful)
5. Focus on itinerary clarity with day-by-day and type-based views
6. Support multi-city trips where location changes during the trip

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Group trip organizers (bachelor/bachelorette parties, destination weddings, ski trips, friend vacations)
- **Secondary**: Event coordinators needing shared itineraries (corporate retreats, family reunions)

## Terminology

| Term              | Definition                                                                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trip**          | The overall group travel plan (equivalent to "Event" in Partiful)           |
| **Event**         | Individual items in the trip itinerary (flights, dinners, activities, etc.) |
| **Organizer**     | Trip creator and co-organizers (equivalent to "Host" in Partiful)           |
| **Member**        | People invited to/attending the trip (equivalent to "Guest" in Partiful)    |
| **Member Travel** | Individual member arrivals and departures to/from the trip location         |

## Design Considerations

### Multi-City Trips & Location Changes

Trips often involve multiple destinations (e.g., "Paris → Amsterdam → London" or "Miami → Key West → Miami"). Tripful handles this through **Travel events**:

- **Travel events** (flights, trains, drives, ferries, etc.) represent transitions between locations
- The `location` field on Travel events uses arrow notation to show the transition: "Miami → Key West"
- In the day-by-day view, Travel events naturally show when the group is moving to a new location
- The trip's `destination` field represents the primary or overall destination (e.g., "Florida Keys" or "Europe")
- Each event's individual `location` field shows where that specific activity takes place

**Example**: A bachelor party road trip

- Trip destination: "Florida Keys"
- Day 1: Flight to Miami (location: "JFK → MIA")
- Day 1: Dinner in Miami (location: "Miami Beach")
- Day 2: Drive to Key West (location: "Miami → Key West")
- Day 2: Sunset cruise (location: "Key West Marina")
- Day 4: Drive back (location: "Key West → Miami")
- Day 4: Flight home (location: "MIA → JFK")

This approach:

- Works for any trip type (multi-city, road trips, cruises)
- Doesn't require complex trip segmentation
- Leverages existing event types and fields
- Shows location changes naturally in the timeline

## Core User Flows
