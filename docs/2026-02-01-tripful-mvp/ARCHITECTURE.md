#### shadcn/ui Setup

shadcn/ui is a collection of re-usable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. Components are copied directly into your codebase for full customization.

**Installation:**

```bash
# Initialize shadcn/ui in Next.js project
npx shadcn@latest init

# Add components as needed
npx shadcn@latest add dialog
npx shadcn@latest add button
npx shadcn@latest add input
npx shadcn@latest add form
npx shadcn@latest add card
npx shadcn@latest add select
npx shadcn@latest add calendar
npx shadcn@latest add popover
```

**Configuration (components.json):**

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json",
  "style": "new-york",
  "rsc": true,
  "tsx": true,
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.ts",
    "css": "app/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "slate",
    "cssVariables": true
  },
  "iconLibrary": "lucide",
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components",
    "utils": "@/lib/utils",
    "ui": "@/components/ui"
  }
}
```

**Key Components for Tripful:**

- `Dialog` - Event creation, trip settings
- `Form` - All forms with React Hook Form integration
- `Input`, `Textarea` - Form fields
- `Button` - CTAs and actions
- `Card` - Trip cards, event cards
- `Select` - Dropdowns (timezone, event type)
- `Calendar` + `Popover` - Date pickers
- `Badge` - Event types, RSVP status
- `Avatar` - User profiles

#### Key Features

**React Server Components (RSC)**

- Initial page loads with server-rendered content
- Automatic code splitting and optimization
- Direct database access in server components (for public data)
- Reduced client bundle size

**Client Components**

- Interactive UI elements (forms, modals, animations)
- TanStack Query for data fetching and caching
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Real-time timezone conversion

**TanStack Query Integration**

```typescript
// app/providers.tsx
'use client'
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'

function makeQueryClient() {
  return new QueryClient({
    defaultOptions: {
      queries: {
        staleTime: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
        gcTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
        refetchOnWindowFocus: true,
        retry: 1,
      },
    },
  })
}

export function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const queryClient = makeQueryClient()
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      {children}
    </QueryClientProvider>
  )
}
```

#### Routing Strategy

- `/` - Landing page (public)
- `/login` - Phone authentication
- `/verify` - SMS code verification
- `/dashboard` - User's trip list
- `/trips/[id]` - Trip itinerary view (requires RSVP)
- `/trips/[id]/settings` - Trip settings (organizer only)
- `/create-trip` - Create new trip

**Modal/Dialog Patterns:**

- Events, accommodations, and member travel are created via **shadcn/ui Dialog** components (not routes)
- Edit operations also use dialogs for better UX
- Reduces navigation complexity and provides better mobile experience

#### Fastify Configuration

**Plugin Architecture with `buildApp()`**

The API uses a `buildApp()` factory pattern for testable server setup. All services are registered as Fastify plugins using `fastify-plugin` and injected via `fastify.decorate()`.

```typescript
// src/app.ts - Configures and returns a fully wired FastifyInstance
export async function buildApp(
  opts: BuildAppOptions,
): Promise<FastifyInstance> {
  const fastify = Fastify(opts.fastify);

  // 1. Core plugins (config must be first, database depends on config)
  await fastify.register(configPlugin);
  await fastify.register(databasePlugin);

  // 2. Security & middleware plugins
  await fastify.register(cors, {
    origin: fastify.config.FRONTEND_URL,
    credentials: true,
  });
  await fastify.register(helmet, { contentSecurityPolicy: false });
  await fastify.register(rateLimit, { max: 100, timeWindow: "15 minutes" });
  await fastify.register(jwt, { secret: fastify.config.JWT_SECRET });
  await fastify.register(cookie);
  await fastify.register(multipart, {
    limits: { fileSize: fastify.config.MAX_FILE_SIZE },
  });

  // 3. Service plugins (decorated onto fastify instance)
  await fastify.register(authServicePlugin);
  await fastify.register(tripServicePlugin);
  await fastify.register(permissionsServicePlugin);
  await fastify.register(uploadServicePlugin);
  await fastify.register(smsServicePlugin);
  await fastify.register(healthServicePlugin);

  // 4. Error handler + routes
  fastify.setErrorHandler(errorHandler);
  await fastify.register(healthRoutes, { prefix: "/api/health" });
  await fastify.register(authRoutes, { prefix: "/api/auth" });
  await fastify.register(tripRoutes, { prefix: "/api/trips" });
  await fastify.register(eventRoutes, { prefix: "/api" });
  await fastify.register(accommodationRoutes, { prefix: "/api" });
  await fastify.register(memberTravelRoutes, { prefix: "/api" });
  await fastify.register(invitationRoutes, { prefix: "/api" });
  await fastify.register(userRoutes, { prefix: "/api/users" });

  return fastify;
}
```

```typescript
// src/server.ts - Production entry point
const app = await buildApp({
  fastify: { logger: { level: config.LOG_LEVEL } },
});
await app.listen({ port: config.PORT, host: config.HOST });

// Graceful shutdown via close-with-grace
```

**Registered Fastify Plugins**

- `@fastify/cors` - CORS handling (allows frontend origin)
- `@fastify/jwt` - JWT authentication with httpOnly cookies
- `@fastify/rate-limit` - Rate limiting (global + per-endpoint)
- `@fastify/helmet` - Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- `@fastify/multipart` - File uploads with size limits
- `@fastify/cookie` - Cookie parsing for JWT
- `@fastify/under-pressure` - Health monitoring
- `@fastify/static` - Static file serving (uploads)
- `@fastify/error` - Typed error creation
- `@fastify/swagger` - API documentation (future)

### 3. Database Layer (PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM)

#### Drizzle Configuration

```typescript
// drizzle.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit";

export default defineConfig({
  schema: "./src/db/schema",
  out: "./src/db/migrations",
  dialect: "postgresql",
  dbCredentials: {
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL!,
  },
  verbose: true,
  strict: true,
});
```

#### Schema Examples

**Users Table**

```typescript
// src/db/schema/users.ts
import { pgTable, uuid, text, timestamp, varchar } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

export const users = pgTable("users", {
  id: uuid("id").primaryKey().defaultRandom(),
  phoneNumber: varchar("phone_number", { length: 20 }).notNull().unique(),
  displayName: varchar("display_name", { length: 50 }).notNull(),
  profilePhotoUrl: text("profile_photo_url"),
  timezone: varchar("timezone", { length: 100 }).notNull().default("UTC"),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at", { withTimezone: true })
    .notNull()
    .defaultNow(),
  updatedAt: timestamp("updated_at", { withTimezone: true })
    .notNull()
    .defaultNow(),
});

export type User = typeof users.$inferSelect;
export type NewUser = typeof users.$inferInsert;
```

**Verification Codes Table**

```typescript
// src/db/schema/verification_codes.ts
import { pgTable, varchar, timestamp } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

export const verificationCodes = pgTable("verification_codes", {
  phoneNumber: varchar("phone_number", { length: 20 }).primaryKey(),
  code: varchar("code", { length: 6 }).notNull(),
  expiresAt: timestamp("expires_at", { withTimezone: true }).notNull(),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at", { withTimezone: true })
    .notNull()
    .defaultNow(),
});

export type VerificationCode = typeof verificationCodes.$inferSelect;
export type NewVerificationCode = typeof verificationCodes.$inferInsert;
```

**Members Table (trip membership and RSVP status)**

```typescript
// src/db/schema/members.ts
import { pgTable, uuid, timestamp, pgEnum } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";
import { trips, users } from ".";

export const rsvpStatusEnum = pgEnum("rsvp_status", [
  "going",
  "not_going",
  "maybe",
  "no_response",
]);

export const members = pgTable("members", {
  id: uuid("id").primaryKey().defaultRandom(),
  tripId: uuid("trip_id")
    .notNull()
    .references(() => trips.id, { onDelete: "cascade" }),
  userId: uuid("user_id")
    .notNull()
    .references(() => users.id, { onDelete: "cascade" }),
  status: rsvpStatusEnum("status").notNull().default("no_response"),
  updatedAt: timestamp("updated_at", { withTimezone: true })
    .notNull()
    .defaultNow(),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at", { withTimezone: true })
    .notNull()
    .defaultNow(),
});

export type Member = typeof members.$inferSelect;
export type NewMember = typeof members.$inferInsert;
```

**Note:** The `members` table represents trip membership and RSVP status. When a user is invited, a member record is created with status `no_response`. This table serves dual purpose: membership tracking and response status.

**Trips Table**

```typescript
// src/db/schema/trips.ts
import {
  pgTable,
  uuid,
  varchar,
  text,
  date,
  timestamp,
  boolean,
} from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";
import { users } from "./users";

export const trips = pgTable("trips", {
  id: uuid("id").primaryKey().defaultRandom(),
  name: varchar("name", { length: 100 }).notNull(),
  destination: text("destination").notNull(),
  startDate: date("start_date"),
  endDate: date("end_date"),
  preferredTimezone: varchar("preferred_timezone", { length: 100 }).notNull(),
  description: text("description"),
  coverImageUrl: text("cover_image_url"),
  createdBy: uuid("created_by")
    .notNull()
    .references(() => users.id),
  allowMembersToAddEvents: boolean("allow_members_to_add_events")
    .notNull()
    .default(true),
  cancelled: boolean("cancelled").notNull().default(false),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at", { withTimezone: true })
    .notNull()
    .defaultNow(),
  updatedAt: timestamp("updated_at", { withTimezone: true })
    .notNull()
    .defaultNow(),
});

export type Trip = typeof trips.$inferSelect;
export type NewTrip = typeof trips.$inferInsert;
```

**Events Table**

```typescript
// src/db/schema/events.ts
import {
  pgTable,
  uuid,
  varchar,
  text,
  date,
  time,
  timestamp,
  boolean,
  pgEnum,
} from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";
import { trips, users } from ".";

export const eventTypeEnum = pgEnum("event_type", [
  "travel",
  "meal",
  "activity",
]);

export const events = pgTable("events", {
  id: uuid("id").primaryKey().defaultRandom(),
  tripId: uuid("trip_id")
    .notNull()
    .references(() => trips.id, { onDelete: "cascade" }),
  createdBy: uuid("created_by")
    .notNull()
    .references(() => users.id),
  eventType: eventTypeEnum("event_type").notNull(),
  title: varchar("title", { length: 200 }).notNull(),
  startDate: date("start_date").notNull(),
  endDate: date("end_date"),
  startTime: time("start_time"),
  endTime: time("end_time"),
  allDay: boolean("all_day").notNull().default(false),
  location: varchar("location", { length: 500 }),
  meetupLocation: text("meetup_location"),
  meetupTime: timestamp("meetup_time", { withTimezone: true }),
  description: text("description"),
  links: text("links").array(),
  isOptional: boolean("is_optional").notNull().default(false),
  deletedAt: timestamp("deleted_at", { withTimezone: true }),
  deletedBy: uuid("deleted_by").references(() => users.id),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at", { withTimezone: true })
    .notNull()
    .defaultNow(),

```

**Travel Table (member arrivals/departures)**

```typescript
// src/db/schema/travel.ts
import {
  pgTable,
  uuid,
  varchar,
  text,
  date,
  time,
  timestamp,
  pgEnum,
} from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

```typescript
// src/db/schema/index.ts
import { relations } from "drizzle-orm";
import * as schema from ".";

export const usersRelations = relations(schema.users, ({ many }) => ({
  tripsCreated: many(schema.trips),

  members: many(schema.members),
}));

export const tripsRelations = relations(schema.trips, ({ one, many }) => ({

    fields: [schema.trips.createdBy],
    references: [schema.users.id],
  }),
  events: many(schema.events),

```

#### Database Queries with Drizzle

```typescript
// Example: Get trip with events and creator info
import { db } from "@/config/database";
import { trips, events, users } from "@/db/schema";
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";

const tripWithDetails = await db
  .select({
    trip: trips,
    creator: users,
  })
  .from(trips)
  .leftJoin(users, eq(trips.createdBy, users.id))
  .where(eq(trips.id, tripId))
  .limit(1);

const tripEvents = await db
  .select()
  .from(events)
  .where(eq(events.tripId, tripId))
  .orderBy(events.startDate, events.startTime);
```

### 4. Service Layer (Business Logic)

#### Abstract Service Interfaces

**SMS Service**

```typescript
// src/services/sms.service.ts
export interface ISMSService {
  sendVerificationCode(phoneNumber: string, code: string): Promise<void>;
  sendInvitation(
    phoneNumber: string,
    tripName: string,
    tripLink: string,
  ): Promise<void>;
  sendTripUpdate(phoneNumber: string, message: string): Promise<void>;
  sendCancellation(phoneNumber: string, tripName: string): Promise<void>;
}

// Mock implementation for MVP
export class MockSMSService implements ISMSService {
  async sendVerificationCode(phoneNumber: string, code: string) {
    console.log(`[MOCK SMS] Verification code for ${phoneNumber}: ${code}`);
    // In development: Also log to a file or display in UI
  }

  async sendInvitation(
    phoneNumber: string,
    tripName: string,
    tripLink: string,
  ) {
    console.log(`[MOCK SMS] Invitation to ${phoneNumber}:`);
    console.log(`You've been invited to ${tripName}! ${tripLink}`);
  }

  async sendTripUpdate(phoneNumber: string, message: string) {
    console.log(`[MOCK SMS] Trip update to ${phoneNumber}: ${message}`);
  }

  async sendCancellation(phoneNumber: string, tripName: string) {
    console.log(
      `[MOCK SMS] Cancellation to ${phoneNumber}: ${tripName} has been cancelled`,
    );
  }
}

// Future Twilio implementation
export class TwilioSMSService implements ISMSService {
  // Real implementation with Twilio SDK
}
```

**Storage Service**

```typescript
// src/services/storage.service.ts
export interface IStorageService {
  uploadFile(file: Buffer, filename: string, mimeType: string): Promise<string>;
  deleteFile(url: string): Promise<void>;
  getSignedUrl(url: string, expiresIn?: number): Promise<string>;
}

// Mock implementation for MVP
export class MockStorageService implements IStorageService {
  private files = new Map<string, Buffer>();

  async uploadFile(file: Buffer, filename: string, mimeType: string) {
    const fileId = `mock-${Date.now()}-${filename}`;
    this.files.set(fileId, file);
    return `http://localhost:8000/mock-storage/${fileId}`;
  }

  async deleteFile(url: string) {
    const fileId = url.split("/").pop()!;
    this.files.delete(fileId);
  }

  async getSignedUrl(url: string, expiresIn = 3600) {
    return `${url}?expires=${Date.now() + expiresIn * 1000}`;
  }
}

// Future S3 implementation
export class S3StorageService implements IStorageService {
  // Real implementation with AWS SDK
}
```

#### Permission Service

```typescript
// src/services/permissions.service.ts

### Core Tables

See [Database Layer](#3-database-layer-postgresql--drizzle-orm) section for detailed schema definitions.

**Primary Tables:**

1. ✅ `users` - User accounts
2. ✅ `verification_codes` - Phone verification codes with expiry
3. ✅ `trips` - Trip information
4. ✅ `members` - **Trip membership, RSVP status, and co-organizer tracking** (combined entity)
5. ✅ `invitations` - Trip invitations by phone with batch invite flow
6. ✅ `events` - Itinerary events with event_type enum (travel, meal, activity) and soft delete
7. ✅ `accommodations` - Multi-day lodging with date ranges and soft delete
8. ✅ `member_travel` - Individual member arrivals/departures with soft delete

**Note on Members:** The `members` table serves as the trip membership table. When a user is invited, a member record is created, making them a trip member. The `status` field tracks their RSVP response (going/not_going/maybe/no_response). This design keeps membership and status in sync.

**Note on Co-Organizers:** Co-organizers are identified by the `isOrganizer` boolean column on the members table. The trip creator (trips.createdBy) is automatically an organizer, and additional co-organizers are flagged via `isOrganizer = true`. This explicit column replaced the earlier role-based approach for clearer permission checks.

**Indexes:**

- `users.phone_number` (unique)
- `trips.created_by`
- `events.trip_id, events.start_date` (composite)
- `members.user_id, members.trip_id` (composite, unique)
- `members.id` (primary key)
- `invitations.invitee_phone_number, invitations.trip_id` (composite)

Authentication: Required

Response (200):
  {
    "success": true,
    "data": [
      {
        "id": "uuid",
        "name": "Summer Vacation",
        "destination": "Hawaii",
        "startDate": "2026-07-01",
        "endDate": "2026-07-10",
        "preferredTimezone": "Pacific/Honolulu",
        "description": "Beach vacation with friends",
        "coverImageUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
        "allowMembersToAddEvents": true,
        "cancelled": false,
        "createdBy": "uuid",
        "createdAt": "2026-02-01T...",
        "updatedAt": "2026-02-01T...",
        "isOrganizer": true,
        "rsvpStatus": "going",
        "organizerInfo": [
          {

            "displayName": "John Doe",
            "profilePhotoUrl": null
          }
        ],
        "memberCount": 5,
        "eventCount": 12
      }
    ],
    "meta": {
      "page": 1,
      "limit": 50,
      "total": 1,
      "totalPages": 1
    }
  }

Additional Information:
  - Returns all trips where user is organizer or member
  - Includes role information (isOrganizer)
  - Includes RSVP status for member trips
  - Includes organizer list and counts
  - Ordered by start date (descending), then created date (descending)
```

**2. Get Trip Details**

```http
GET /api/trips/:id
Authentication: Required

Response (200):
  {
    "success": true,
    "data": {
      "trip": {
        "id": "uuid",
        "name": "Summer Vacation",
        "destination": "Hawaii",
        "startDate": "2026-07-01",
        "endDate": "2026-07-10",
        "preferredTimezone": "Pacific/Honolulu",
        "description": "Beach vacation with friends",
        "coverImageUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
        "allowMembersToAddEvents": true,
        "cancelled": false,
        "createdBy": "uuid",
        "createdAt": "2026-02-01T...",
        "updatedAt": "2026-02-01T..."
      },
      "creator": {
        "id": "uuid",
        "displayName": "John Doe",
        "profilePhotoUrl": null
      },
      "organizers": [
        {
          "id": "uuid",
          "displayName": "John Doe",
          "profilePhotoUrl": null
        }
      ],
      "isOrganizer": true,
      "rsvpStatus": "going"
    }
  }

Note: The "organizers" array is populated from the members table (all members with status='going'), not from a separate organizers junction table. This design simplifies the schema while maintaining co-organizer functionality.

Response (404 - Not Found):
  {
    "success": false,
    "error": {
      "code": "NOT_FOUND",
      "message": "Trip not found"
    }
  }

Response (403 - Forbidden):
  {
    "success": false,
    "error": {
      "code": "FORBIDDEN",
      "message": "You must be a member of this trip"

Note: For MVP, verification codes are stored in the database with expiry timestamps.
This eliminates the need for in-memory storage or Redis for simple verification flows.
```

### JWT Token Structure (✅ Implemented)

**Token Payload** (generated by `apps/api/src/services/auth.service.ts`):

```typescript
interface JWTPayload {
  sub: string; // User ID (UUID)
  phone: string; // Phone number in E.164 format
  name: string; // Display name (empty if profile incomplete)
  iat: number; // Issued at timestamp
  exp: number; // Expires at (iat + 7 days)
}
```

**Signing Configuration** (`apps/api/src/server.ts`):

- Algorithm: HS256
- Secret: From JWT_SECRET env var (min 32 characters)
- Expiration: 7 days
- Stored in httpOnly cookie: `auth_token`
  - Path: `/`
  - SameSite: `strict`
  - Secure: `true` (production only)

### Authentication Middleware (✅ Implemented)

**File:** `apps/api/src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts`

#### 1. `authenticate()` Middleware

Validates JWT from cookie or Authorization header:

```typescript
export async function authenticate(
  request: FastifyRequest,
  reply: FastifyReply,
) {
  try {
    // Check cookie first, fallback to Authorization header
    const token =
      request.cookies.auth_token ||
      request.headers.authorization?.replace("Bearer ", "");

    if (!token) {
      return reply.status(401).send({
        success: false,
        error: {
          code: "UNAUTHORIZED",
          message: "Missing authentication token",
        },
      });
    }

    // Verify JWT signature and expiry
    const decoded = await request.server.jwt.verify<JWTPayload>(token);

    // Attach user to request object
    request.user = {
      id: decoded.sub,
      phoneNumber: decoded.phone,
      displayName: decoded.name,
    };
  } catch (err) {
    return reply.status(401).send({
      success: false,
      error: {
        code: "UNAUTHORIZED",
        message: "Invalid or expired token",
      },
    });
  }
}
```

#### 2. `requireCompleteProfile()` Middleware

Ensures authenticated user has completed their profile:

```typescript
export async function requireCompleteProfile(
  request: FastifyRequest,
  reply: FastifyReply,
) {
  // Must have displayName to access protected features
  if (!request.user?.displayName || request.user.displayName.trim() === "") {
    return reply.status(403).send({
      success: false,
      error: {
        code: "PROFILE_INCOMPLETE",
        message: "Please complete your profile first",
      },
    });
  }
}
```

**Usage in Routes:**

```typescript
// Protected route requiring auth
fastify.get("/api/trips", { preHandler: authenticate }, tripsController.list);

// Protected route requiring complete profile
fastify.post(
  "/api/trips",
  { preHandler: [authenticate, requireCompleteProfile] },
  tripsController.create,
);
```

## Trip Management Flow

### Trip Creation and Management (✅ Implemented)

**Services Layer:**

1. **TripService** (`apps/api/src/services/trip.service.ts`)
   - CRUD operations for trips
   - List user's trips with role and RSVP information
   - Co-organizer management
   - Member and organizer tracking

2. **PermissionsService** (`apps/api/src/services/permissions.service.ts`)
   - Check if user is organizer
   - Check if user can perform specific actions
   - Enforce permission rules based on trip settings

3. **UploadService** (`apps/api/src/services/upload.service.ts`)
   - Handle file uploads with validation
   - Support for trip cover images
   - File size and MIME type validation
   - Cleanup of old files

**Database Schema:**

```typescript
// Trips table
export const trips = pgTable("trips", {
  id: uuid("id").primaryKey().defaultRandom(),
  name: varchar("name", { length: 100 }).notNull(),
  destination: text("destination").notNull(),
  startDate: date("start_date"),
  endDate: date("end_date"),
  preferredTimezone: varchar("preferred_timezone", { length: 100 }).notNull(),
  description: text("description"),
  coverImageUrl: text("cover_image_url"),
  createdBy: uuid("created_by")
    .notNull()
    .references(() => users.id),
  allowMembersToAddEvents: boolean("allow_members_to_add_events")
    .notNull()
    .default(true),
  cancelled: boolean("cancelled").notNull().default(false),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at", { withTimezone: true })
    .notNull()
    .defaultNow(),
  updatedAt: timestamp("updated_at", { withTimezone: true })
    .notNull()
    .defaultNow(),
});

// Members table (includes RSVP status and co-organizer tracking)
// Note: Co-organizers are identified by status='going' rather than a separate table
export const members = pgTable("members", {
  id: uuid("id").primaryKey().defaultRandom(),
  tripId: uuid("trip_id")
    .notNull()
    .references(() => trips.id, { onDelete: "cascade" }),
  userId: uuid("user_id")
    .notNull()
    .references(() => users.id, { onDelete: "cascade" }),
  status: rsvpStatusEnum("status").notNull().default("no_response"),
  updatedAt: timestamp("updated_at", { withTimezone: true })
    .notNull()
    .defaultNow(),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at", { withTimezone: true })
    .notNull()
    .defaultNow(),
});
```

**Permission Rules:**

1. **Organizer Actions** (must be organizer):
   - Update trip details (name, destination, dates, description)
   - Change trip settings (allowMembersToAddEvents)
   - Add/remove co-organizers
   - Upload/delete cover images
   - Cancel/delete trip

2. **Member Actions** (based on RSVP status and settings):
   - View trip details (any member)
   - Add events (if RSVP="going" AND trip allows OR is organizer)
   - Edit own events (if still RSVP="going")
   - Delete own events (if still RSVP="going")

3. **Trip Creator Special Rules**:
   - Cannot be removed as organizer
   - Always has full permissions

**Frontend Components:**

1. **Dashboard** (`apps/web/src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`)
   - Lists all user's trips grouped by status
   - Search functionality
   - Trip grouping: Your Trips, Other Trips, Past Trips
   - CreateTripDialog trigger button

2. **CreateTripDialog** (`apps/web/src/components/trip/create-trip-dialog.tsx`)
   - Two-step form:
     - Step 1: Basic info (name, destination, dates, timezone)
     - Step 2: Optional details (description, cover image)
   - Zod validation with inline errors
   - TanStack Query mutation for optimistic updates

3. **TripCard** (`apps/web/src/components/trip/trip-card.tsx`)
   - Displays trip summary with cover image
   - Shows RSVP status badge
   - Shows organizer badge if applicable
   - Displays organizer avatars (stacked, max 3)
   - Shows event count
   - Animated entrance with staggered delays

4. **Trip Detail Page** (`apps/web/src/app/(app)/trips/[id]/page.tsx`)
   - Full trip information display
   - EditTripDialog trigger (organizers only)
   - Future: Events list, accommodations, member travel

5. **EditTripDialog** (`apps/web/src/components/trip/edit-trip-dialog.tsx`)
   - Tabbed interface:
     - **Details**: Edit basic trip info
     - **Settings**: Manage permissions and co-organizers
     - **Cover Image**: Upload/replace/delete image
     - **Delete**: Cancel trip (danger zone)
   - Permission-based rendering (organizers only)
   - Optimistic updates with TanStack Query

6. **ImageUpload** (`apps/web/src/components/trip/image-upload.tsx`)
   - Drag-and-drop or click to upload
   - File validation (size, type)
   - Image preview with metadata
   - Clear selection button

**API Flow Example - Creating a Trip:**

```
User Action → Frontend → API → Database → Response
─────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. User clicks "Create Trip" button
   └─> Opens CreateTripDialog

2. User fills Step 1 (name, destination, dates, timezone)
   └─> Validates locally with Zod schema
   └─> Clicks "Next" to Step 2

3. User fills Step 2 (description, cover image)
   └─> Validates locally with Zod schema
   └─> Clicks "Create Trip"

4. Frontend: TanStack Query mutation
   └─> POST /api/trips (trip data without image)
   └─> Optimistic update: Add trip to cache

5. API: TripService.createTrip()
   ├─> Validate request with Zod schema
   ├─> Check user has complete profile
   ├─> Insert into trips table
   ├─> Insert creator as organizer
   ├─> Insert creator as member (status: "going")
   └─> Return created trip

6. Frontend: Upload cover image (if selected)
   └─> POST /api/trips/:id/cover-image (multipart/form-data)

7. API: UploadService.uploadFile()
   ├─> Validate file size (<= 5MB)
   ├─> Validate MIME type (image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp)
   ├─> Save file to uploads/ directory
   ├─> Update trip.coverImageUrl
   └─> Return image URL

8. Frontend: Success
   ├─> Close dialog
   ├─> Invalidate trips query cache
   ├─> Navigate to trip detail page
   └─> Show success toast
```

**Environment Variables:**

```bash
# File upload configuration
UPLOAD_DIR=uploads                                    # Directory for uploaded files
MAX_FILE_SIZE=5242880                                # 5MB in bytes
ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES=image/jpeg,image/png,image/webp  # Accepted image formats
```

**Testing:**

- **Unit Tests**: TripService, PermissionsService, UploadService
- **Integration Tests**: All 9 trip API endpoints
- **E2E Tests**: Complete trip management flows (902 lines, 4 test suites)
  - Trip creation with 2-step form
  - Trip editing with all tabs
  - Permission enforcement
  - Co-organizer management

## Key Features Implementation

### 1. Timezone Handling

**Strategy:**

- Store all dates/times in UTC in the database
- Each trip has a `preferredTimezone` field (IANA timezone identifier)
- Users can toggle between trip timezone and their local timezone in UI

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Backend: Save times in UTC
import { utcToZonedTime, zonedTimeToUtc } from 'date-fns-tz'

function convertToUTC(dateTime: Date, timezone: string): Date {
  return zonedTimeToUtc(dateTime, timezone)
}

// Frontend: Display in trip timezone or user timezone
import { formatInTimeZone } from 'date-fns-tz'

function formatEventTime(
  utcDateTime: Date,
  displayTimezone: string,
  format: string = 'h:mm a'
): string {
  return formatInTimeZone(utcDateTime, displayTimezone, format)
}

// Example usage in component
function EventCard({ event, trip, userTimezone, showInLocalTime }) {
  const displayTimezone = showInLocalTime ? userTimezone : trip.preferredTimezone
  const timeStr = formatEventTime(event.startTime, displayTimezone)

  return <div>{timeStr}</div>
}
```

### 2. Soft Delete Pattern

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Soft delete event
async function deleteEvent(eventId: string, userId: string) {
  await db
    .update(events)
    .set({
      deletedAt: new Date(),
      deletedBy: userId,
      updatedAt: new Date(),
    })
    .where(eq(events.id, eventId));
}

// Restore event
async function restoreEvent(eventId: string) {
  await db
    .update(events)
    .set({
      deletedAt: null,
      deletedBy: null,
      updatedAt: new Date(),
    })
    .where(eq(events.id, eventId));
}

// Query non-deleted events
const activeEvents = await db
  .select()
  .from(events)
  .where(and(eq(events.tripId, tripId), isNull(events.deletedAt)));

// Organizers can view deleted items
const deletedEvents = await db
  .select()
  .from(events)
  .where(and(eq(events.tripId, tripId), isNotNull(events.deletedAt)));
```

### 3. Permission System

**Permission Matrix:**

| Action                     | Member (Going) | Member (Not Going) | Organizer |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| View itinerary             | ✓              | ✗                  | ✓         |
| Add event                  | ✓\*            | ✗                  | ✓         |
| Edit own event             | ✓              | ✗                  | ✓         |
| Delete own event           | ✓              | ✗                  | ✓         |
| Edit any event             | ✗              | ✗                  | ✓         |
| Delete any event           | ✗              | ✗                  | ✓         |
| Add accommodation          | ✗              | ✗                  | ✓         |
| Add member travel (self)   | ✓              | ✗                  | ✓         |
| Add member travel (others) | ✗              | ✗                  | ✓         |
| Edit trip                  | ✗              | ✗                  | ✓         |
| Invite members             | ✗              | ✗                  | ✓         |

\*Only if trip setting `allowMembersToAddEvents` is enabled

### 4. Optimistic Updates

**TanStack Query Implementation:**

```typescript
// hooks/useTripEvents.ts
import { useMutation, useQueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";

export function useAddEvent(tripId: string) {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: (newEvent: NewEvent) => api.events.create(tripId, newEvent),

    // Optimistic update
    onMutate: async (newEvent) => {
      // Cancel outgoing refetches
      await queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey: ["events", tripId] });

      // Snapshot previous value
      const previousEvents = queryClient.getQueryData(["events", tripId]);

      // Optimistically update
      queryClient.setQueryData(["events", tripId], (old: Event[]) => [
        ...old,
        { ...newEvent, id: "temp-id", createdAt: new Date() },
      ]);

      return { previousEvents };
    },

    // Rollback on error
    onError: (err, newEvent, context) => {
      queryClient.setQueryData(["events", tripId], context.previousEvents);
    },

    // Refetch on success
    onSettled: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["events", tripId] });
    },
  });
}
```

### 5. Multi-Day Events

**Display Strategy:**

- Events with `endDate` different from `startDate` appear once on the start date
- Show "Multi-day" badge with date range (e.g., "Oct 12-14")
- Do NOT duplicate across each day

**Query Implementation:**

```typescript
// Group events by day, handling multi-day events
function groupEventsByDay(events: Event[]) {
  const grouped = new Map<string, Event[]>();

  events.forEach((event) => {
    // Multi-day events only appear on start date
    const dateKey = format(event.startDate, "yyyy-MM-dd");

    if (!grouped.has(dateKey)) {
      grouped.set(dateKey, []);
    }
    grouped.get(dateKey)!.push(event);
  });

  return grouped;
}
```

### ✅ E2E Tests (Playwright) - 4 Scenarios Implemented

**Location:** `apps/web/tests/e2e/auth-flow.spec.ts`

**Configuration:** `apps/web/playwright.config.ts`

- Base URL: http://localhost:3000
- Timeout: 30 seconds per test
- Sequential execution (no parallelism for DB isolation)
- Auto-start both API (8000) and web (3000) servers
- HTML reporter with screenshots on failure

**Implemented Test Scenarios:**

#### Test 1: Complete Authentication Journey

```typescript
test("complete authentication flow from login to dashboard", async ({
  page,
}) => {
  const phoneNumber = `+1555${Date.now()}`;

  // 1. Login page - enter phone number
  await page.goto("/login");
  await page.fill('input[type="tel"]', phoneNumber.slice(2));
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  // 2. Verify page - enter code
  await page.waitForURL("/verify*");
  await page.fill('input[maxlength="6"]', "123456");
  await page.click('button:has-text("Verify")');

  // 3. Complete profile
  await page.waitForURL("/complete-profile");
  await page.fill('input[name="displayName"]', "Test User");
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  // 4. Dashboard - verify logged in
  await page.waitForURL("/dashboard");
  await expect(page.locator("text=Test User")).toBeVisible();

  // 5. Verify auth cookie set
  const cookies = await page.context().cookies();
  const authCookie = cookies.find((c) => c.name === "auth_token");
  expect(authCookie).toBeDefined();
  expect(authCookie?.httpOnly).toBe(true);
  expect(authCookie?.secure).toBe(true); // In production
});
```

#### Test 2: Logout Flow

```typescript
test("logout clears cookie and redirects to login", async ({ page }) => {
  // Complete auth flow first
  // ...

  // Logout
  await page.click('button:has-text("Logout")');
  await page.waitForURL("/login");

  // Verify cookie cleared
  const cookies = await page.context().cookies();
  const authCookie = cookies.find((c) => c.name === "auth_token");
  expect(authCookie).toBeUndefined();

  // Verify cannot access protected route
  await page.goto("/dashboard");
  await page.waitForURL("/login");
});
```

#### Test 3: Protected Route Access

```typescript
test("accessing protected route without auth redirects to login", async ({
  page,
}) => {
  await page.goto("/dashboard");
  await page.waitForURL("/login");
});
```

#### Test 4: Existing User Path

```typescript
test("existing user skips profile completion", async ({ page }) => {
  // Create user via API
  const phoneNumber = `+1555${Date.now()}`;
  await fetch("http://localhost:8000/api/auth/request-code", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ phoneNumber }),
  });
  await fetch("http://localhost:8000/api/auth/verify-code", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ phoneNumber, code: "123456" }),
  });

  // Complete profile via API
  // ...

  // Login again
  await page.goto("/login");
  await page.fill('input[type="tel"]', phoneNumber.slice(2));
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
  await page.fill('input[maxlength="6"]', "123456");
  await page.click('button:has-text("Verify")');

  // Should go directly to dashboard (skip profile)
  await page.waitForURL("/dashboard");
});
```

**Running E2E Tests:**

```bash
# From root
pnpm test:e2e

# From web directory
cd apps/web
pnpm test:e2e              # Headless mode
pnpm test:e2e:ui           # Playwright UI
pnpm test:e2e:headed       # Headed browser mode
```

**All 4 E2E tests passing.**

### Test Coverage Goals & Strategy

**Backend Testing:**

- Unit tests colocated with services (`service.ts` + `service.test.ts`)
- Focus on business logic and edge cases
- Target: 70%+ coverage for services
- Integration tests for all API endpoints

**Frontend Testing:**

- Focus on **integration tests** over unit tests
- Avoid over-testing individual components
- Test **core workflows** end-to-end
- Use Playwright for critical user journeys

**Test Organization:**

```
apps/api/src/
├── services/
│   ├── auth.service.ts
│   ├── auth.service.test.ts      # Colocated unit tests
│   ├── trips.service.ts
│   └── trips.service.test.ts

apps/web/
├── app/
│   └── trips/
│       └── __tests__/            # Integration tests for workflows
│           └── create-trip.test.tsx
```

**Priority:**

1. E2E tests for critical flows (auth, trip creation, RSVP, event management)
2. Backend integration tests (API endpoints)
3. Backend unit tests (services with complex logic)
4. Frontend integration tests (multi-component workflows)
5. Frontend unit tests (only for complex utilities)

---

## Security Considerations

### 1. Authentication Security

- **JWT Tokens**: Signed with strong secret, 7-day expiration
- **Refresh Strategy**: New token on each request (optional)
- **Cookie Storage**: `httpOnly`, `secure`, `sameSite: strict`
- **Rate Limiting**: 5 attempts per phone number per hour for SMS codes

### 2. Authorization

- **Trip Access**: Verify phone number in invitations table before showing preview
- **Event Permissions**: Check RSVP status and organizer role
- **Resource Ownership**: Validate user owns resource before updates

### 3. Input Validation

- **Zod Route Schemas**: Routes use `fastify-type-provider-zod` for schema validation at the route level
- **Shared Schemas**: Zod schemas shared between frontend and backend (`@tripful/shared/schemas`)
- **Typed Errors**: All API errors use `@fastify/error` with specific error codes and HTTP status codes
- **File Uploads**: Validate MIME types, file size limits (configurable via `MAX_FILE_SIZE`)

```typescript
// Route-level Zod schema validation
fastify.post(
  "/request-code",
  {
    schema: { body: requestCodeSchema },
    preHandler: fastify.rateLimit(smsRateLimitConfig),
  },
  authController.requestCode,
);

// Typed errors (src/errors.ts)
const TripNotFoundError = createError("TRIP_NOT_FOUND", "Trip not found", 404);
const PermissionDeniedError = createError("PERMISSION_DENIED", "...", 403);
```

### 3a. Security Headers

- **Helmet**: `@fastify/helmet` adds security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, etc.)
- **CSP**: Content Security Policy disabled for development (configurable)

### 4. Data Privacy

- **Phone Numbers**: Hashed in database (but kept readable for SMS)
- **PII Protection**: Minimal data collection, no tracking
- **Soft Delete**: Data retained but marked deleted (GDPR consideration)

### 5. SQL Injection Prevention

- **Drizzle ORM**: Parameterized queries by default
- **No Raw SQL**: Avoid `.sql` unless necessary and carefully reviewed

### 6. CORS Configuration

```typescript
fastify.register(cors, {
  origin: process.env.FRONTEND_URL,
  credentials: true,
  methods: ["GET", "POST", "PATCH", "DELETE"],
});
```

### 7. Rate Limiting

```typescript
// Global rate limit (registered in buildApp)
fastify.register(rateLimit, { max: 100, timeWindow: "15 minutes" });

// Per-endpoint rate limits (src/middleware/rate-limit.middleware.ts)
smsRateLimitConfig:     // 5 requests/hour per phone number
verifyCodeRateLimitConfig: // 10 attempts/15 minutes per phone number
```

### 8. Health Endpoints

Three health endpoints for monitoring and orchestration:

- `GET /api/health` - Full status with database connection check
- `GET /api/health/live` - Liveness probe (instant 200)
- `GET /api/health/ready` - Readiness probe (503 if DB unavailable)

---

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Database Optimization

**Indexes**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_events_trip_date ON events(trip_id, start_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_members_user_trip ON members(user_id, trip_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_invitations_phone ON invitations(invitee_phone_number);
CREATE INDEX idx_verification_codes_expiry ON verification_codes(expires_at);
```

**Query Optimization**

- Use Drizzle's `leftJoin` for related data in single query
- Limit results with `.limit()` and `.offset()`
- Select only needed columns with `.select({ ... })`

### 2. Caching Strategy

**Database-Based Verification Codes (MVP)**

For MVP, verification codes are stored directly in the database with expiry timestamps:

```typescript
// Database verification code service
class VerificationCodeService {
  async set(phoneNumber: string, code: string, ttlMinutes: number = 5) {
    const expiresAt = new Date(Date.now() + ttlMinutes * 60 * 1000);

    await db
      .insert(verificationCodes)
      .values({
        phoneNumber,
        code,
        expiresAt,
      })
      .onConflictDoUpdate({
        target: verificationCodes.phoneNumber,
        set: { code, expiresAt, createdAt: new Date() },
      });
  }

  async get(phoneNumber: string): Promise<string | null> {
    const result = await db
      .select()
      .from(verificationCodes)
      .where(eq(verificationCodes.phoneNumber, phoneNumber))
      .limit(1);

    if (!result[0]) return null;

    // Check expiry
    if (new Date() > result[0].expiresAt) {
      await this.delete(phoneNumber);
      return null;
    }

    return result[0].code;
  }

  async delete(phoneNumber: string) {
    await db
      .delete(verificationCodes)
      .where(eq(verificationCodes.phoneNumber, phoneNumber));
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- No need for Redis or in-memory storage in MVP
- Automatic cleanup via periodic job or trigger
- Persists across server restarts
- Simpler deployment

**Production:** Consider Redis for high-volume scenarios and distributed caching.

**TanStack Query Caching** (Frontend)

- `staleTime: 60000` (1 minute) - Consider data fresh
- `gcTime: 300000` (5 minutes) - Cache persists in background
- Automatic background refetching on window focus

### 3. Next.js Optimizations

**React Server Components**

- Initial page loads with pre-rendered content
- Reduced client JavaScript bundle
- Streaming SSR for faster Time to First Byte (TTFB)

**Image Optimization**

```tsx
import Image from "next/image";

<Image
  src={trip.coverImageUrl}
  alt={trip.name}
  width={800}
  height={400}
  priority={false}
/>;
```

**Code Splitting**

- Automatic route-based splitting
- Dynamic imports for modals and heavy components

```tsx
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";

const EventFormModal = dynamic(() => import("@/components/EventFormModal"), {
  ssr: false,
  loading: () => <Spinner />,
});
```

### 4. API Response Times

**Goals:**

- GET endpoints: <200ms (p95)
- POST/PATCH endpoints: <500ms (p95)
- File uploads: <2s (p95)

**Optimization Techniques:**

- Connection pooling for PostgreSQL
- Redis for session storage (not database)
- Compress responses with `@fastify/compress`

```typescript
fastify.register(compress, {
  encodings: ["gzip", "deflate"],
});
```

### 5. Frontend Performance

**Bundle Size**

- Target: <200KB initial JS bundle (gzipped)
- Use tree-shaking for unused code
- Lazy load routes and components

**Rendering Performance**

- Use `React.memo` for expensive list items
- Virtualize long event lists (future: `react-window`)
- Debounce search/filter inputs
