# Progress: Trip Photo Upload Service

## Iteration 1 — Task 1.1: Add trip_photos table and shared types/schemas

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### What was done
- Added `photoStatusEnum` (processing/ready/failed) and `tripPhotos` table to `apps/api/src/db/schema/index.ts`
- Added `tripPhotosRelations` to `relations.ts` with trip and uploader relations; added `photos: many(tripPhotos)` to tripsRelations and `uploadedPhotos: many(tripPhotos)` to usersRelations
- Generated migration `0023_icy_genesis.sql` — creates enum, table, indexes (trip_id, uploaded_by), foreign keys (cascade on trip_id)
- Created `shared/types/photo.ts` with PhotoStatus, Photo, GetPhotosResponse, UploadPhotosResponse, UpdatePhotoResponse
- Created `shared/schemas/photo.ts` with updatePhotoCaptionSchema (caption max 200 chars)
- Exported from barrel files in `shared/types/index.ts` and `shared/schemas/index.ts`

### Verification
- **Typecheck**: PASS (all 3 packages: shared, api, web)
- **Lint**: PASS (all 3 packages)
- **Tests**: 1168 API tests passed, 321 shared tests passed, 1159 web tests passed. 6 API failures + 5 web failures are pre-existing (MinIO/S3 and trip content component tests), not caused by this change.
- **Migration**: Generated and applied successfully
- **Reviewer**: APPROVED — exact match to architecture spec

### Learnings
- All imports needed for schema (pgTable, uuid, varchar, text, timestamp, index, pgEnum, integer) were already present in schema/index.ts
- Pre-existing test failures exist in MinIO/S3 integration tests (cover image, profile photo) and web component tests (trips-content, trip-detail-content) — these are not related to photo feature work

## Iteration 2 — Task 2.1: Create ImageProcessingService and PhotoService with worker

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### What was done
- Installed `sharp` dependency in apps/api
- Created `ImageProcessingService` (`apps/api/src/services/image-processing.service.ts`) — pure service that re-encodes images to WebP q85 using sharp
- Created `PhotoService` (`apps/api/src/services/photo.service.ts`) — DB service with 8 CRUD methods for trip_photos table (getPhotosByTripId, getPhotoById, getPhotoCount, createPhotoRecord, updatePhotoUrl, updateCaption, setPhotoFailed, deletePhoto)
- Created Fastify plugin wrappers: `plugins/image-processing-service.ts` and `plugins/photo-service.ts`
- Created photo processing worker (`apps/api/src/queues/workers/photo-processing.worker.ts`) — downloads raw from storage, processes to WebP, uploads, updates DB, deletes raw. Marks photo as failed on final retry (retryCount >= 2).
- Added `PHOTO_PROCESSING` and `PHOTO_PROCESSING_DLQ` queue constants and `PhotoProcessingPayload` type to `queues/types.ts`
- Registered photo-processing queue (DLQ first, retryLimit: 3, retryBackoff: true) and worker in `queues/index.ts` with `downloadBuffer` closure supporting both S3 and local storage
- Exposed `storage` decorator from `upload-service.ts` for worker access; added `photoService`, `imageProcessingService`, `storage` to FastifyInstance type augmentation
- Registered both new service plugins in `app.ts`

### Tests written
- `tests/unit/image-processing.service.test.ts` (6 tests): JPEG/PNG/WebP to WebP conversion, dimension preservation, RIFF header validation, invalid input rejection
- `tests/unit/photo.service.test.ts` (13 tests): All 8 service methods with real DB (create, get by ID, get by trip, count, update URL with status transition, update caption, set failed, delete with/without URL)
- `tests/unit/photo-processing.worker.test.ts` (6 tests): Happy path pipeline, logging, early retry (no setPhotoFailed), final retry (calls setPhotoFailed), retryCount > 2, failure at different stages

### Verification
- **Typecheck**: PASS (all 3 packages)
- **Lint**: PASS (all 3 packages)
- **New tests**: 25/25 passed across 3 test files
- **Full suite**: 11 failures are all pre-existing (same as iteration 1)
- **Reviewer**: APPROVED — clean architecture compliance, good pattern consistency, thorough test coverage

### Learnings
- Workers live in `apps/api/src/queues/workers/` (not a separate `src/workers/` directory) — follow codebase convention over architecture spec literal
- Queue naming convention uses slash-delimited format: `photo/process` (not `photo-processing`) to match existing patterns like `notification/batch`
- `WorkerDeps` was not extended to avoid impacting all workers; instead a dedicated `PhotoProcessingDeps` interface was created for the photo worker
- The `IStorageService` interface doesn't have a `download`/`getObject` method — the `downloadBuffer` function was implemented as a closure in queue registration, handling both S3 (via `S3StorageService.getObject`) and local storage (via `fs.readFile`)
- `storage` was exposed as a Fastify decorator from `upload-service.ts` to make it accessible to queue workers
- pg-boss v12's `Job` type doesn't expose `retryCount`; `JobWithMetadata` type is needed with a cast since the runtime object always has it

## Iteration 3 — Task 3.1: Create photo routes and controller with integration tests

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### What was done
- Created `apps/api/src/controllers/photo.controller.ts` with 4 handlers: `uploadPhotos` (multi-file multipart), `getPhotos`, `updateCaption`, `deletePhoto`
- Created `apps/api/src/routes/photo.routes.ts` with GET `/`, POST `/`, PATCH `/:photoId`, DELETE `/:photoId` — follows scoped write routes pattern with `authenticate` + `requireCompleteProfile`
- Added `PhotoNotFoundError` to `apps/api/src/errors.ts`
- Registered `photoRoutes` in `apps/api/src/app.ts` at prefix `/api/trips/:id/photos`
- Changed multipart config `files: 1` → `files: 5` in `app.ts`
- Extracted `assertUploaderOrOrganizer` helper to deduplicate permission checks in updateCaption and deletePhoto
- Added `tripIdParamsSchema` for UUID validation on GET and POST routes (consistency with PATCH/DELETE which use `photoIdParamsSchema`)
- Upload handler enforces 20-photo-per-trip limit (including in-batch count), validates files via `uploadService.validateImage`, uploads raw to storage, enqueues pg-boss `photo/process` job
- Delete handler cleans up processed image from storage; raw file cleanup delegated to worker (documented edge case for mid-processing deletes)

### Tests written
- `apps/api/tests/integration/photo.routes.test.ts` (18 tests):
  - Upload: single file (201), multiple files (201)
  - Upload errors: no auth (401), non-member (403), invalid file type (400), 20-photo limit (400)
  - List: photos sorted DESC (200 with order verification), empty array (200), non-member (403)
  - Update caption: own photo (200), organizer on other's photo (200), non-owner non-organizer (403), photo not found (404)
  - Delete: own photo (200 with DB verification), organizer (200), non-owner non-organizer (403), not found (404), no auth (401)

### Verification
- **Typecheck**: PASS (all 3 packages)
- **Lint**: PASS (all 3 packages)
- **New tests**: 18/18 passed when run in isolation (702ms)
- **Full suite**: 13 failures — all pre-existing (8 API: S3/MinIO upload concurrency, 5 web: component tests)
- **Reviewer**: APPROVED after one round of fixes (param validation, sort order test assertion, permission helper extraction, raw file cleanup documentation)

### Learnings
- Photo routes use nested prefix `/api/trips/:id/photos` — the `:id` param comes from the parent prefix, not the route path itself
- Multipart routes can still set `params` schema even without `body` schema — useful for UUID validation
- File upload integration tests that touch storage (S3/MinIO) fail in full suite due to concurrency/ordering but pass in isolation — this is a pre-existing environment issue affecting all upload tests
- The `assertUploaderOrOrganizer` pattern with a parameterized `action` string provides contextual error messages while keeping DRY code
- Empty string caption is intentional — allows clearing captions via PATCH

## Iteration 4 — Task 4.1: Create TanStack Query hooks and PhotoUploadDropzone

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### What was done
- Created `apps/web/src/hooks/photo-queries.ts` — query key factory (`photoKeys`) with `all: (tripId) => ["trips", tripId, "photos"]` and `photosQueryOptions` with 30s staleTime using `apiRequest<GetPhotosResponse>`
- Created `apps/web/src/hooks/use-photos.ts` — 4 hooks:
  - `usePhotos(tripId)` — query hook with `enabled: !!tripId`
  - `useUploadPhotos(tripId)` — mutation using raw `fetch()` with `FormData` (not `apiRequest`, since it force-sets JSON content type). Invalidates query on settle.
  - `useUpdatePhotoCaption(tripId)` — mutation with optimistic caption update (cancel queries → snapshot → setQueryData → rollback on error → invalidate on settle)
  - `useDeletePhoto(tripId)` — mutation with optimistic removal from cache
- Created `apps/web/src/components/photos/photo-upload-dropzone.tsx` — multi-file drag-drop upload component with:
  - Client-side validation: file type (JPEG/PNG/WebP), size (5MB), batch limit (5), remaining capacity
  - Per-file progress tracking with blob URL previews
  - Remaining count display ("X photos remaining")
  - Disabled state when limit reached
  - Keyboard accessibility (Enter/Space to open file picker, role="button", aria-label)
- Exported companion error message helpers: `getUploadPhotosErrorMessage`, `getUpdatePhotoCaptionErrorMessage`, `getDeletePhotoErrorMessage`

### Tests written
- `apps/web/src/hooks/__tests__/use-photos.test.tsx` (19 tests): query fetch (success/empty/error), upload mutation (FormData via fetch, cache invalidation, error handling), caption update (optimistic + rollback), delete (optimistic removal + rollback), all error message helpers
- `apps/web/src/components/photos/__tests__/photo-upload-dropzone.test.tsx` (25 tests): rendering, disabled state, file validation (type/size/capacity/batch), drag-and-drop, file selection, upload progress, multi-file, accessibility

### Verification
- **Typecheck**: PASS (all 3 packages)
- **Lint**: PASS (0 errors, 0 warnings — removed unnecessary eslint-disable comments for non-existent rules)
- **New tests**: 44/44 passed (19 hook + 25 component)
- **Full suite**: All pre-existing failures only (same as iteration 3)
- **Reviewer**: APPROVED — excellent pattern consistency, correct use of raw fetch for multipart, proper optimistic updates with rollback

### Learnings
- ESLint config in this project uses flat config and does NOT include `react-hooks` or `@next/next` plugins — eslint-disable comments referencing these non-existent rules cause lint errors ("Definition for rule X was not found")
- `apiRequest()` from `@/lib/api` auto-sets `Content-Type: application/json` when body is present — file uploads MUST use raw `fetch()` with `FormData` and `credentials: "include"` (matching `use-user.ts` pattern)
- Upload mutation intentionally has no optimistic update — photos start as `status: "processing"` with `url: null`, so there's nothing meaningful to show optimistically. Just invalidate on settle.
- The two-file pattern (`*-queries.ts` for server-safe options + `use-*.ts` for client hooks) is strictly followed throughout the codebase

## Iteration 5 — Task 5.1: Create PhotoGrid, PhotoCard, PhotoLightbox, and PhotosSection

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### What was done
- Created `apps/web/src/components/photos/photo-card.tsx` — 3 visual states (processing skeleton, ready with image + hover overlay, failed with error icon), `next/image` with responsive `sizes`, delete button with `stopPropagation`, keyboard accessible (`role="button"`, `tabIndex`, Enter/Space)
- Created `apps/web/src/components/photos/photo-grid.tsx` — responsive CSS grid (2/3/4 cols at mobile/tablet/desktop), `EmptyState` component with Camera icon for empty state
- Created `apps/web/src/components/photos/photo-lightbox.tsx` — full-screen overlay (`role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`), keyboard navigation (Escape/ArrowLeft/ArrowRight), touch swipe with 50px threshold, inline caption editing (Enter to save, Escape to cancel, blur to save), delete with smart navigation (goes to previous when deleting last photo, closes when deleting only photo), body scroll lock, `aria-live="polite"` counter
- Created `apps/web/src/components/photos/photos-section.tsx` — collapsible section matching existing pattern, header with count "Photos (N/20)", integrates PhotoUploadDropzone + PhotoGrid + PhotoLightbox, `useAuth()` for permission checks, maps grid indices to ready-photo indices for lightbox
- Created `apps/web/src/components/photos/index.ts` — barrel export for all photo components
- Added `PhotosSection` to `trip-detail-content.tsx` via dynamic import (`ssr: false`), placed between itinerary and discussion sections with border-top separator

### Tests written
- `apps/web/src/components/photos/__tests__/photo-card.test.tsx` (9 tests): processing skeleton state, non-clickable processing/failed states, image src resolution, click/delete handlers, canModify visibility, delete stopPropagation
- `apps/web/src/components/photos/__tests__/photo-grid.test.tsx` (4 tests): grid rendering, empty state, click index passing, canModify propagation per card
- Updated `trip-detail-content.test.tsx` — added `PhotosSection` mock to prevent QueryClientProvider errors from dynamic import

### Verification
- **Typecheck**: PASS (all 3 packages)
- **Lint**: PASS (all 3 packages)
- **New tests**: 13/13 passed (9 photo-card + 4 photo-grid)
- **Trip-detail-content tests**: 61/61 passed (41 previously broken tests now fixed via mock)
- **Full frontend suite**: 1218/1221 passed (3 pre-existing FAB failures in trips-content.test.tsx)
- **Full API suite**: 1209/1217 passed (8 pre-existing MinIO/S3 flaky failures)
- **Reviewer**: APPROVED after one round of fixes (hooks ordering, onBlur save, delete stale closure, aria attributes, constant extraction)

### Learnings
- Dynamic imports with `ssr: false` that use TanStack Query hooks will crash tests that don't provide QueryClientProvider — mock the dynamically imported component in test files
- React Rules of Hooks: never place hooks after early returns — move all hooks above any conditional returns and guard inside the hook callbacks instead
- `vi.fn()` in strict TypeScript returns `Mock<Procedure | Constructable>` which doesn't assign to typed function props — use `vi.fn() as unknown as () => void` pattern
- Caption input `onBlur` should save (not cancel) for better UX — Escape key handler cancels before blur fires since React batches state updates and unmounts the input
- Delete in lightbox needs pre-mutation snapshot of `photos.length - 2` for boundary check since optimistic updates may change the array before `onSuccess` fires
- Pre-existing diagnostics in trip-detail-content.test.tsx (cannot find module `@/hooks/use-trips`, `require` type, `Date` not assignable to `string`) are from the existing test file and unrelated to this task
