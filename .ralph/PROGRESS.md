## Iteration 1 — Task 1.1: Bump all dependency versions and update CI config

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Date**: 2026-02-17

### What was done
Bumped all dependency versions from 3 Dependabot PRs (#20, #22, #23) into a single consolidated set of changes:

- **CI config**: Updated `actions/cache@v4` → `@v5` (2 occurrences in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Root package.json**: 7 devDependency bumps (eslint ^10.0.0, @eslint/js ^10.0.1, @typescript-eslint/* ^8.56.0, globals ^17.3.0, lint-staged ^16.2.7, turbo ^2.8.9)
- **API package.json**: 7 dependency bumps + 2 devDependency bumps (zod ^4.3.6, fastify-type-provider-zod ^6.1.0, @fastify/cors ^11.2.0, @fastify/jwt ^10.0.0, drizzle-orm ^0.45.1, dotenv ^17.3.1, fastify ^5.7.4, @types/node ^25.2.3, drizzle-kit ^0.31.9)
- **Web package.json**: 6 dependency bumps + 7 devDependency bumps (zod ^4.3.6, @hookform/resolvers ^5.2.2, tailwind-merge ^3.4.1, @tanstack/react-query ^5.90.21, vitest ^4.0.18, jsdom ^28.1.0, @vitejs/plugin-react ^5.1.4, etc.)
- **Shared package.json**: 1 dependency bump + 1 devDependency bump (zod ^4.3.6, vitest ^4.0.18)
- **Lockfile**: Regenerated successfully via `pnpm install` (1430 insertions, 2067 deletions)

### Verification
- All 28 version strings verified correct across 5 files
- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` confirms lockfile is in sync
- Only 6 expected files modified (5 config files + lockfile)
- zod consistently at ^4.3.6 across all 3 packages
- vitest consistently at ^4.0.18 across all 3 packages

### Reviewer verdict
APPROVED — All dependencies accounted for, consistent caret ranges, no unrelated changes.

### Learnings for future iterations
- PR diff values are authoritative over PR body tables (some version minimums differ slightly)
- Additional deps were found in PR diffs beyond what ARCHITECTURE.md listed (fastify, @tanstack/react-query, lucide-react, react-day-picker, @typescript-eslint/*, @playwright/test, @types/react, eslint in web)
- Peer dependency warnings exist for eslint 10 + eslint-config-next/eslint-plugin-import — may need attention in Task 3.1
- Breaking changes (Zod 4, ESLint 10, fastify ecosystem) are deferred to Tasks 2.1–3.1 as planned
