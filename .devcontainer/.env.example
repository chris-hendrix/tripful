# Devcontainer Environment Variables
#
# IMPORTANT: These variables must be EXPORTED in your shell environment!
# Add them to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
#
#   export HOST_USERNAME=yourusername
#   export HOST_PROJECT_SLUG=-home-yourusername-git-tripful
#
# Devcontainer.json reads from your host environment, not from .env files.
#
# See README.md for full setup instructions.

# REQUIRED: Your host system username
# Used to create symlinks so Claude plugins can find their files
# Example: If your home is /home/john, set this to "john"
export HOST_USERNAME=

# REQUIRED: Claude project slug for this repository
# Format: Convert your project path by replacing / with -
# Example: /home/john/git/tripful -> -home-john-git-tripful
# Find yours: ls ~/.claude/projects/ | grep tripful
export HOST_PROJECT_SLUG=

# OPTIONAL: JWT secret for API authentication
# If not set, a random secret will be generated automatically
# To use a specific secret: export JWT_SECRET=your-secret-here-minimum-32-characters
export JWT_SECRET=
